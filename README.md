# Family Rights Resource Hub

Welcome to the Family Rights Resource Hub, a collaborative open-source project dedicated to supporting same-sex parents, LGBTQ+ families, and their allies. Our mission is to provide accessible, accurate, and up-to-date legal guides, informational documents, and best practices that empower families to navigate legal systems and advocate for their rights.

## Mission Statement

We believe that every family deserves equal legal recognition, protection, and support regardless of their structure. This hub aims to:
- **Educate** families about their legal rights and options.
- **Empower** individuals and communities with actionable knowledge.
- **Advocate** for equitable policies and practices through evidence-based resources.
- **Foster** a collaborative network of legal professionals, advocates, and families.
